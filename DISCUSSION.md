# Empathy-Driven Design 

The UI was designed with a strong focus on user needs in healthcare, patients’ ease of use, and compliance with WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines):

- **Healthcare Alignment**: The UI organizes advocate data in a clear, concise way so users can quickly find relevant advocates.  
- **User Focus**: Information such as specialties, years of experience, and contact details are surfaced with minimal friction, reducing the effort required for users making important health decisions.  
- **WCAG Standards**: Accessibility guidelines were considered to ensure inclusivity. Features like responsive layouts, readable typography, proper color contrast, and semantic structuring help support patients of varying abilities.  

Overall, the design emphasizes **clarity, inclusivity, and trust**, ensuring the Advocates UI is both user-friendly and aligned with accessibility best practices.  



# Solace Advocates UI Improvements – Alternatives to Horizontal Scroll & Filtering

## Column Prioritization  
Show only key fields on smaller screens, hide secondary columns.

## Details Panel  
Keep the table compact, open a sidebar/drawer for full info on row click.

## Card Layout  
On mobile, switch to stacked cards instead of a table for easier scrolling.

## Filtering & Sorting Improvements

- **Filtering**: Allow users to narrow advocates by specialty, city, or role to quickly find relevant matches.  
- **Sorting**: Enable sorting by years of experience, name, or location for better control over results.  
- **User-Centric Impact**: Users gain faster, more intuitive access to the right advocate, reducing cognitive load and supporting informed healthcare decisions.  
- **WCAG Alignment**: Filters and sorting controls should be keyboard-accessible, screen-reader friendly, and provide clear visual feedback for inclusivity.
